	  <h2>What is it?</h2>
	  
	  <p class="longText">The customer journey map is a tool that we use to communicate the journey of our <a href="audience.html">contributors</a> and their points of interaction with the Marketplace service. The entire service is combined under a catchall term called ‘Mozilla’ for the sake of simplicity, but can be broken down further into e.g. Editorial Team, Community Team, system, and so on.</p>
	  
	  <p class="longText">The map doesn’t aim to represent the deepest details. There’s no screen prototype or detailed feature requirement. Instead, it conveys actions, processes, and information flow between multiple actors. For instance: somebody goes here, then the info is handed off to this system, then the system does this, then it’s handed off to some other person, etc.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Needs and Answers (a.k.a. Behaviours, Triggers, etc.)</h2>
	  
	  <p class="longText">Before we look at the map, it’s helpful to look at what each <a href="audience.html">user type</a> <strong>needs</strong> in each phase, <strong>activities</strong> they do to seek fulfilment, and what <strong>answers</strong> will Marketplace service need to have for those needs.</p>
	  
	  <p class="longText">Put simply, this is a table of what everybody wants, and how everybody go about getting what they want.</p>
