	  <h3>What is it?</h3>
	  
	  <p class="longText">The customer journey map is a tool that we use to communicate the journey of our <a href="audience.html">users</a> and their points of interaction with the Firefox Marketplace service. The entire service is combined under a catchall term called ‘Mozilla’ for the sake of simplicity, but can be broken down into e.g. Editorial Team, Community Team, system, and so on.</p>
	  
	  <p class="longText">The map doesn’t aim to represent the deepest details. There’s no screen prototype or detailed feature requirement. Instead, it conveys actions, processes, and information flow between multiple actors in a servvice. For instance: somebody goes here, then the info is handed off to this system, then the system does this, then after this it’s handed off to some other person, etc.</p>
	  
	  <p class="longText">The journey is structured into four phases:</p>
	  
	  <ol class="longText">
	    <li>Interest, recruitment and entry</li>
	    <li>First contribution</li>
	    <li>Showcase, share and promote</li>
	    <li>Support and future contributions</li>
	  </ol>
	  
	  <h3>Needs and Answers (a.k.a. Behaviours, Triggers, etc.)</h3>
	  
	  <p class="longText">Before we look at the map, it’s helpful to look at what each <a href="audience.html">user type</a> <strong>needs</strong> in each phase, <strong>activities</strong> they do to seek fulfilment, and what <strong>answers</strong> will Marketplace service need to have for those needs.</p>
	  
	  <p class="longText">Put simply, this is a table of what everybody wants, and how everybody go about getting what they want.</p>
