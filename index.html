		<h1>Contributors Editorial Contribution</h1>

		<p class="longText">Contributors are those who are already engaged, or want to get involved in an editorial capacity. Contributors are <em>not</em> every user of the Marketplace. A lot of the activities are going to involve a bit of effort rather than one-tap-and-done.</p>

		<!-- Pagination. If you have more than one page, set the multipage variable in the Frontmatter to true. Editing the pagination code happens in /_includes/homePagination.html. 
		NOTE: This is currently broken in the Jekyll ver of this template.
