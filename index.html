		<h1>Contributors Editorial</h1>
		<p>Specs for contributors’ contribution to Marketplace.</p>
		<p>Contributors: those who are already engaged, or want to get involved in an editorial capacity. Contributors are <em>not</em> every user of the Marketplace. A lot of the activities are going to involve a bit of effort rather than one-tap-and-done.</p>
		<!-- Pagination. If you have more than one page, set the multipage variable in the Frontmatter to true. Editing the pagination code happens in /_includes/homePagination.html. 
		NOTE: This is currently broken in the Jekyll ver of this template.
