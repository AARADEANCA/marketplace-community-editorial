    <p class="longText">This program is self-explanatory. Having just one well-written review – whether it’s positive or negative – will help other users measure the quality of an app. The focus is not to get the most number of reviews for most apps in the Marketplace, but to get the highest quality and well-written reviews for apps that don’t yet have one.</p>
